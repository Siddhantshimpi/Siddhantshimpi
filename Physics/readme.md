## Preliminaries & Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Recommended: [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### Common Packages

Most projects use the following Python packages in Jupyter notebooks:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `sympy` (for symbolic computations)

### Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy jupyter
```

Some projects may require additional packages. Refer to the specific project's notebooks for details.
